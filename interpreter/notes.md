# Interpreter

- a component that processes structured text data
- turns it into separate lexical tokens (**lexing**) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens (**parsing**)


### Motivation

- textual input needs to be processed
    - e.g. turned into OOP structures


- examples:
    - programming language compilers, intepreters and IDEs
    - HTML, XML or similar
    - numeric expressions (3+4/5)
    - regular expressions


- turning strings into OOP based structures in a complicated process


### Summary

- **Lexing** - turns text into set of tokens
- **Parsing** - parse tokens into meaningful constructs
